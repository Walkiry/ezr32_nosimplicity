# ezr32_nosimplicity
A base project to avoid using the the simplicity studio based eclipse

This is project aims to ease development of application on silicon labs hardware (As for now only the EZR32HG is supported).
The project came out because simplicity did not work for me (Download issues, not nowing what is hapenning, compile issues,
the very buggy eclipse etc...).

**Goal is to make it possible for Linux users**. Based to work on GCC toolchain and configurable using Kconfig (linux-kernel like).
