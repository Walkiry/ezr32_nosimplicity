	  Same as running 'make CROSS_COMPILE=prefix-' but stored for

config COMPILE_TEST

	  Some drivers can be compiled on a different platform than they are
	  intended to be run on. Despite they cannot be loaded there (or even
	  when they load they cannot be used due to missing HW support),
	  developers still, opposing to distributors, might want to build such

	  If you are a developer and want to build everything available, say Y
	  here. If you are a user/distributor, say N here to exclude useless
	  drivers to be distributed.

config LOCALVERSION
	string "Local version - append to kernel release"
	help
	  Append an extra string to the end of your kernel version.
	  This will show up when you type uname, for example.
	  The string you set here will be appended after the contents of
	  any files with a filename matching localversion* in your
	  object and source tree, in that order.  Your total string can
	  be a maximum of 64 characters.

config LOCALVERSION_AUTO

	help
	  This will try to automatically determine if the current tree is a
	  release tree by looking for git tags that belong to the current
	  top of tree revision.

	  A string of the format -gxxxxxxxx will be added to the localversion
	  if a git-based tree is found.  The string generated by this will be
	  appended after any matching localversion* files, and after the value
	  set in CONFIG_LOCALVERSION.

	  (The actual string used here is the first eight characters produced
	  by running the command:

	    $ git rev-parse --verify HEAD

	  which is done within the script "scripts/setlocalversion".)

	help
	  The linux kernel is a kind of self-extracting executable.
	  Several compression algorithms are available, which differ
	  in efficiency, compression and decompression speed.
	  Compression speed is only relevant when building a kernel.
	  Decompression speed is relevant at each boot.

	  If you have any problems with bzip2 or lzma compressed
	  kernels, mail me (Alain Knaff) <alain@knaff.lu>. (An older
	  version of this functionality (bzip2 only), for 2.4, was
	  supplied by Christian Ludwig)

	  High compression options are mostly useful for users, who
	  are low on disk space (embedded systems), but for whom ram
	  size matters less.

	  If in doubt, select 'gzip'

config KERNEL_GZIP
	bool "Gzip"
	depends on HAVE_KERNEL_GZIP
	help
	  The old and tried gzip compression. It provides a good balance
	  between compression ratio and decompression speed.

config KERNEL_BZIP2
	bool "Bzip2"
	depends on HAVE_KERNEL_BZIP2
	help
	  Its compression ratio and speed is intermediate.
	  Decompression speed is slowest among the choices.  The kernel
	  size is about 10% smaller with bzip2, in comparison to gzip.
	  Bzip2 uses a large amount of memory. For modern kernels you
	  will need at least 8MB RAM or more for booting.

config KERNEL_LZMA
	bool "LZMA"
	depends on HAVE_KERNEL_LZMA
	help
	  This compression algorithm's ratio is best.  Decompression speed
	  is between gzip and bzip2.  Compression is slowest.
	  The kernel size is about 33% smaller with LZMA in comparison to gzip.

config KERNEL_XZ
	bool "XZ"
	depends on HAVE_KERNEL_XZ
	help
	  XZ uses the LZMA2 algorithm and instruction set specific
	  BCJ filters which can improve compression ratio of executable
	  code. The size of the kernel is about 30% smaller with XZ in
	  comparison to gzip. On architectures for which there is a BCJ
	  filter (i386, x86_64, ARM, IA-64, PowerPC, and SPARC), XZ
	  will create a few percent smaller kernel than plain LZMA.

	  The speed is about the same as with LZMA: The decompression
	  speed of XZ is better than that of bzip2 but worse than gzip
	  and LZO. Compression is slow.

config KERNEL_LZO
	bool "LZO"
	depends on HAVE_KERNEL_LZO
	help
	  Its compression ratio is the poorest among the choices. The kernel
	  size is about 10% bigger than gzip; however its speed
	  (both compression and decompression) is the fastest.

config KERNEL_LZ4
	bool "LZ4"
	depends on HAVE_KERNEL_LZ4
	help
	  LZ4 is an LZ77-type compressor with a fixed, byte-oriented encoding.
	  A preliminary version of LZ4 de/compression tool is available at
	  <https://code.google.com/p/lz4/>.

	  Its compression ratio is worse than LZO. The size of the kernel
	  is about 8% bigger than LZO. But the decompression speed is
	  faster than LZO.

config DEFAULT_HOSTNAME
	string "Default hostname"
	default "(none)"
	help
	  This option determines the default system hostname before userspace
	  calls sethostname(2). The kernel traditionally uses "(none)" here,
	  but you may wish to use a different default here to make a minimal
	  system more usable with less configuration.

config SWAP
	bool "Support for paging of anonymous memory (swap)"
	depends on MMU && BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  This option allows you to choose whether you want to have support
	  for so called swap devices or swap files in your kernel that are
	  used to provide more virtual memory than the actual RAM present
	  in your computer.  If unsure say Y.

config SYSVIPC
	bool "System V IPC"
	---help---
	  Inter Process Communication is a suite of library functions and
	  system calls which let processes (running programs) synchronize and
	  exchange information. It is generally considered to be a good thing,
	  and some programs won't run unless you say Y here. In particular, if
	  you want to run the DOS emulator dosemu under Linux (read the
	  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>),
	  you'll need to say Y here.

	  You can find documentation about IPC with "info ipc" and also in
	  section 6.4 of the Linux Programmer's Guide, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/guides.html>.

config POSIX_MQUEUE
	bool "POSIX Message Queues"
	depends on NET
	---help---
	  POSIX variant of message queues is a part of IPC. In POSIX message
	  queues every message has a priority which decides about succession
	  of receiving it by a process. If you want to compile and run
	  programs written e.g. for Solaris with use of its POSIX message
	  queues (functions mq_*) say Y here.

	  POSIX message queues are visible as a filesystem called 'mqueue'
	  and can be mounted somewhere if you want to do filesystem
	  operations on message queues.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config POSIX_MQUEUE_SYSCTL

config CROSS_MEMORY_ATTACH
	bool "Enable process_vm_readv/writev syscalls"
	depends on MMU
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this option adds the system calls process_vm_readv and
	  process_vm_writev which allow a process with the correct privileges
	  to directly read from or write to another process' address space.
	  See the man page for more details.

config FHANDLE
	bool "open by fhandle syscalls" if EXPERT
	select EXPORTFS
	default y
	help
	  If you say Y here, a user level program will be able to map
	  file names to handle and then later use the handle for
	  different file system operations. This is useful in implementing
	  userspace file servers, which now track files using handles instead
	  of names. The handle would remain the same even if file names
	  get renamed. Enables open_by_handle_at(2) and name_to_handle_at(2)
	  syscalls.

config USELIB
	bool "uselib syscall"
	def_bool ALPHA || M68K || SPARC || X86_32 || IA32_EMULATION
	help
	  This option enables the uselib syscall, a system call used in the
	  dynamic linker from libc5 and earlier.  glibc does not use this
	  system call.  If you intend to run programs built on libc5 or
	  earlier, you may need to enable this syscall.  Current systems
	  running glibc can safely disable this.

config AUDIT
	bool "Auditing support"
	depends on NET
	help
	  Enable auditing infrastructure that can be used with another
	  kernel subsystem, such as SELinux (which requires this for
	  logging of avc messages output).  System call auditing is included
	  on architectures which support it.
